Exception handling: Add try/except blocks to handle file I/O and data errors gracefully.
Parameterize test plans: Allow dynamic loading of different test plans via command-line arguments.
Modularize code: Split code into functions and classes for better maintainability.
Add unit tests: Create tests for your framework logic to ensure reliability.
Generate additional report formats: Support HTML or PDF reports for better sharing.
Visualize more data: Add more plots (e.g., histograms, boxplots) for deeper analysis.
Continuous integration: Set up CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests automatically on push.
User interface: Add a simple CLI or GUI for easier operation.
Documentation: Write clear usage and developer documentation.
